# Introduction to Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of various algorithms described in the [Introduction to Algorithms book](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262258104/introduction-to-algorithms/).
It is part of my attempt at learning Java, and the code is not meant to be used in production.
