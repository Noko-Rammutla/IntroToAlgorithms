# Introduction to Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of various algorithms described in the [Introduction to Algorithms book](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262258104/introduction-to-algorithms/).
It is part of my attempt at learning Java, and the code is not meant to be used in production.

# Requirements

* [OpenJDK 17](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/corretto/latest/corretto-17-ug/downloads-list.html)

# Running

Use the following commands to run the program:

```bash
javac InsertSort.java
java InsertSort
```

It will print out `Hello World` when run successfully.
